# HESS_HAP_extended_emission_and_FB
Repository containing supplementary material on the master's thesis by Fabian Richter.

Additional material on the masters's thesis 'Analysis of extended emission and Fermi Bubbles from H.E.S.S. observations in the vicinity of the Galactic Center' by Fabian Richter can be found here, since putting all information to the thesis itself would have been too much content (and environmental pollution due to paper printing).

However, datafiles for the spectral plots shown in the thesis as well as additional spectra and residuals maps can be found here.
Part of the code that is used to creat the data will be also possibly made public later!
